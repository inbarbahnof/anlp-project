<|im_start|>system
Given a user instruction with its reference response and a numbered list of capabilities, rate each capability on a scale of 1-5 to indicate its relevance in responding to this instruction. A score of 5 means the capability is very used, while 1 means it is not used at all.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
## Task
You are given a user instruction and its reference response, along with a list of {num_capabilities} capabilities. For each capability, rate the degree to which it is required to respond to this instruction.

## User Instruction
{input}

## Reference Response
{output}

## Capabilities
{capability_list}

## Requirements
- For each capability, provide an integer **score from 1 to 5**. A score of 5 means the capability is very used, while 1 means it is not used at all.
- Include a brief **reasoning** for each score, explaining how you determined the score.
- Output the result in **JSON format** as follows:
  ```json
  {
    "1": {"reasoning": "THE REASONING", "score": SCORE},
    "2": {"reasoning": "THE REASONING", "score": SCORE},
    "3": {"reasoning": "THE REASONING", "score": SCORE},
    ...
  }
  ```
- Do NOT include any additional text outside of the JSON format, as **I will directly use `json.loads` in Python to convert your output to a dictionary object**.
