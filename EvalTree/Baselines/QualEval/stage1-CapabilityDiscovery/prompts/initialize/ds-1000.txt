## Task
You are given {instance_num} Python coding problems and their corresponding correct implementations. Identify the high-level programming capabilities required to solve these problems, summarizing any related capabilities under broader categories.

## Problems and Implementations
{inputs_and_outputs}

## Requirements
- Each capability should be an **informative and detailed phrase** that refers to a **specific skill or capability** comprehensively covering key aspects of the solution, without including any specifics from the problems or implementations.
- Where possible, group related capabilities under a single broader capability.
- Output each capability as a standalone phrase, with **no additional text, prefixes, symbols, or notations** on any line.
