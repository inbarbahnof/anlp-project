## Task
You are given {current_num_capabilities} capabilities related to solving Python coding problems. Generate a list of no more than {num_capabilities} capabilities by merging related capabilities into broader items where relevant.

## Capabilities
{capability_list}

## Requirements
- You should output **up to {num_capabilities} capabilities**, ideally exactly {num_capabilities}.
- Each capability should be an **informative and concise phrase** that represents a **specific programming skill or capability** while covering key aspects of the capabilities provided.
- Consolidate related capabilities into a single, broader capability wherever possible to reduce the list length.
- Output each capability as a standalone phrase, with **no additional text, prefixes, symbols, or notations** on any line.
