Your dataset is represented as a pandas DataFrame, and you want to predict house prices based on specific features. You have already preprocessed your data and split it into training and test sets. \n\nNow, you want to create a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn and fit it to your training data. After fitting the model, you want to predict house prices based on new input data stored in a 2D NumPy array. \n\nHere are the relevant libraries you will need to import:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n```\n\nYou have the following training data in a pandas DataFrame:\n```python\ndata = {\n    'size': [1500, 1700, 2000, 2400, 3000],   # in square feet\n    'bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 5, 4],              # number of bedrooms\n    'price': [300000, 350000, 450000, 550000, 650000]  # house prices\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n```\n\nYou want to fit a Linear Regression model on the `size` and `bedrooms` to predict `price`. \n\nAfter defining your input data for predictions as a NumPy array:\n```python\nX_new = np.array([[1800, 3], [2200, 4], [2600, 5]])\n```\n\nFill in the blank to complete the model training and prediction:\n```python\nX = df[['size', 'bedrooms']]\ny = df['price']\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Fit the Linear Regression model\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict prices for new inputs\npredicted_prices = ___\n```\nThe variable `predicted_prices` should now contain the predicted house prices for the `X_new` input data.",

Consider that I have one-hot encoded predictions and true labels and want to focus the loss on the class specified by its index. For example, if the index is 2, the loss should only be calculated for this class.\n\nGiven two tensors: `y_true` representing the true labels and `y_pred` representing the predicted labels, how can I implement this custom loss function to compute the loss focusing only on the designated class index? The `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors have the shape (n, 5) for a 5-class problem.\n\nA:\n<code>\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, class_index):\n    # calculate the loss focused on class_index\n    pass\n</code>"

    "Problem:\nYou are provided with two DataFrames, `sales` and `returns`, structured as follows:\n\n`sales`:\n```\n    OrderID    Date       Product  Amount\n0      101 2021-01-01   Widget A     20\n1      102 2021-01-02   Widget B     30\n2      103 2021-01-03   Widget A     25\n3      104 2021-01-04   Widget C     50\n4      105 2021-01-05   Widget B     40\n```\n\n`returns`:\n```\n    OrderID    Date       Product  Amount\n0      102 2021-01-03   Widget B     10\n1      104 2021-01-06   Widget C     50\n2      101 2021-01-01   Widget A     5\n```\n\nYour goal is to create a consolidated DataFrame that combines `sales` and `returns`, adjusting the `Amount` for returning products. For each `OrderID`, if there is a matching entry in `returns`, the `Amount` in `sales` should be reduced by the `Amount` from `returns`. If the `Amount` becomes negative, it should be set to zero. Additionally, you need to format the `Date` to \"dd-MMM-yyyy\" and sort the results by `Date`.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame should look like:\n```\n    OrderID    Date       Product  Amount\n0      101 01-Jan-2021   Widget A     15\n1      102 02-Jan-2021   Widget B     20\n2      103 03-Jan-2021   Widget A     25\n3      104 04-Jan-2021   Widget C      0\n4      105 05-Jan-2021   Widget B     40\n```\n\nAssuming you've already imported pandas and created the dataframes, complete the code below:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsales = pd.DataFrame({\n    'OrderID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],\n    'Date': pd.to_datetime(['2021-01-01', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-03', '2021-01-04', '2021-01-05']),\n    'Product': ['Widget A', 'Widget B', 'Widget A', 'Widget C', 'Widget B'],\n    'Amount': [20, 30, 25, 50, 40]\n})\n\nreturns = pd.DataFrame({\n    'OrderID': [102, 104, 101],\n    'Date': pd.to_datetime(['2021-01-03', '2021-01-06', '2021-01-01']),\n    'Product': ['Widget B', 'Widget C', 'Widget A'],\n    'Amount': [10, 50, 5]\n})\n\nresult = ... # put solution in this variable\n```",

First, remove duplicate entries in the `sales_data` based on the `item_id`, keeping the last occurrence.\n2. Calculate the final sales amount for each category after applying the discount. \n3.
