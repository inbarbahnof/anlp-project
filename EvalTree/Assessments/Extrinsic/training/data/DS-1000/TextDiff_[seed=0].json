    "input": "Problem:\nYou are working with two pandas dataframes representing sales data for different products. The first dataframe, `df_sales`, contains information about sales transactions and includes the columns `TransactionID`, `ProductID`, and `Amount`. The second dataframe, `df_products`, includes `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `Category`. \n\nHere are the details of the dataframes:\n\ndf_sales:\n```\n+----------------+------------+--------+\n| TransactionID  | ProductID  | Amount |\n+----------------+------------+--------+\n|        1       |     A      |  250   |\n|        2       |     B      |  400   |\n|        3       |     A      |  150   |\n|        4       |     C      |  300   |\n|        5       |     B      |  200   |\n+----------------+------------+--------+\n```\n\ndf_products:\n```\n+------------+--------------+-----------+\n| ProductID  | ProductName  | Category  |\n+------------+--------------+-----------+\n|     A      | Product A    | Category 1|\n|     B      | Product B    | Category 1|\n|     C      | Product C    | Category 2|\n|     D      | Product D    | Category 2|\n+------------+--------------+-----------+\n```\n\nYour task is to merge these two dataframes so that for each transaction in `df_sales`, you can display the `TransactionID`, `ProductName`, and `Amount`. If a transaction references a `ProductID` that does not exist in `df_products`, the `ProductName` should display `None`. \n\nTo achieve this, fill in the following Python code snippet where `result` will store the merged data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf_sales = pd.DataFrame({\n    'TransactionID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'ProductID': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'],\n    'Amount': [250, 400, 150, 300, 200]\n})\n\ndf_products = pd.DataFrame({\n    'ProductID': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],\n    'ProductName': ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C', 'Product D'],\n    'Category': ['Category 1', 'Category 1', 'Category 2', 'Category 2']\n})\n\nresult = ... # put solution in this variable\n```\n",

The `employees` DataFrame contains employee information, and the `departments` DataFrame contains department details. Your goal is to perform a merge operation where you include employee details alongside their respective department information, ensuring to include all employees even those who might not belong to any department.\n\nHere are the DataFrames:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nemployees = pd.DataFrame({\n    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],\n    'DepartmentID': [100, 101, None, 100]\n})\n\ndepartments = pd.DataFrame({\n    'DepartmentID': [100, 101, 102],\n    'DepartmentName': ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT']\n})\n```\n\nYou want to merge these two DataFrames such that the resulting DataFrame contains the following columns: `EmployeeID`, `Name`, `DepartmentID`, and `DepartmentName`. If an employee belongs to a department, the department's name should appear; if not, it should show as `NaN`.\n\nHow should you fill in the blank to achieve this via a left merge?\n\n```python\nresult = pd.merge(____, _____, how='left', on='DepartmentID')\n```\n",

    "input": "Problem:\nI'm using tensorflow 2.12.0. I want to implement a custom loss function to penalize predictions based on their absolute differences from the true values. The loss should be calculated as the mean of the absolute differences for a batch of predictions and true targets. My predictions are a tensor of shape (batch_size, number_of_classes), and the true values are given as a tensor of the same shape. I want to create a function that computes this custom loss function efficiently. \n\nHere is the setup for my predictions and true values:\n```python\npredictions = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.4, 0.5],\n                            [0.2, 0.2, 0.6],\n                            [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]])\ntrue_values = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0],\n                            [0, 0, 1],\n                            [1, 0, 0]])\n```\nWhat is the correct implementation of my custom loss function, which should return a single scalar value representing the average of the absolute differences?\n\nA:\n<code>\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef custom_loss(predictions, true_values):\n    # Implement the loss function here\n    ### BEGIN SOLUTION\n</code>",
