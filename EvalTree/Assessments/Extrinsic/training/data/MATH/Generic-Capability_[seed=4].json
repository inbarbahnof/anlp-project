According to the problem, the length \\( l \\) of the field is 30 meters longer than the width. Therefore, we can express the length as:\n   \\[\n   l = w + 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the area equation**:\n   The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = l \\times w\n   \\]\n   We know from the problem that the area is 540 square meters. Substituting the expression for length into the area formula gives us:\n   \\[\n   540 = (w + 30) \\times w\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand the equation**:\n   Expanding the right side, we have:\n   \\[\n   540 = w^2 + 30w\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rearrange the equation**:\n   To form a standard quadratic equation, we rearrange it:\n   \\[\n   w^2 + 30w - 540 = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Use the quadratic formula**:\n   The quadratic formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   In our equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 30 \\), and \\( c = -540 \\). We first calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\):\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = 30^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-540) = 900 + 2160 = 3060\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the square root of the discriminant**:\n   Now we find \\( \\sqrt{3060} \\). We can simplify this:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{3060} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 85} = 6\\sqrt{85}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Substitute back into the quadratic formula**:\n   Now we substitute back into the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{-30 \\pm 6\\sqrt{85}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{-30}{2} \\pm \\frac{6\\sqrt{85}}{2} = -15 \\pm 3\\sqrt{85}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the possible values for \\( w \\)**:\n   Since width cannot be negative, we only consider the positive solution:\n   \\[\n   w = -15 + 3\\sqrt{85}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Approximate \\( \\sqrt{85} \\)**:\n   We can approximate \\( \\sqrt{85} \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{85} \\approx 9.22 \\quad (\\text{since } 9^2 = 81 \\text{ and } 10^2 = 100)\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   w \\approx -15 + 3 \\times 9.22 = -15 + 27.66 \\approx 12.66\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final answer**:\n   The width of the field, rounded to two decimal places, is approximately \\( 12.66 \\) meters. However, since we are asked for the width in meters, we can express it as:\n   \\[\n   w \\approx 12.66 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the width of the field is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) meters when rounded to the nearest whole number."
