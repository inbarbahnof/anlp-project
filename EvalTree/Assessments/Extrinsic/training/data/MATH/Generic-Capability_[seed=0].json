The prime factorization of 72 is:\n   \\[\n   72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n   \\]\n   To find the divisors, we can use the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization. The number of divisors is given by multiplying the incremented exponents:\n   \\[\n   (3+1)(2+1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n   Now, we can list the divisors of 72. The divisors can be found by taking combinations of the prime factors:\n   - \\(1\\)\n   - \\(2\\)\n   - \\(3\\)\n   - \\(4\\)\n   - \\(6\\)\n   - \\(8\\)\n   - \\(9\\)\n   - \\(12\\)\n   - \\(18\\)\n   - \\(24\\)\n   - \\(36\\)\n   - \\(72\\)\n\n   So, the divisors of 72 are: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\).\n\n2. **Identify the multiples of 6**:\n   Next, we find the multiples of 6. The multiples of 6 are numbers of the form \\(6n\\) where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. The first few multiples of 6 are:\n   - \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 11 = 66\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\)\n\n3. **Find the common numbers**:\n   Now, we need to find the smallest number that is both a divisor of 72 and a multiple of 6. From our lists:\n   - The divisors of 72 are: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\).\n   - The multiples of 6 are: \\(6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72\\).\n\n   The common numbers from both lists are:\n   - \\(6\\)\n   - \\(12\\)\n   - \\(18\\)\n   - \\(24\\)\n   - \\(36\\)\n   - \\(72\\)\n\n4. **Determine the smallest common number**:\n   Among the common numbers \\(6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\), the smallest is \\(6\\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 72 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

    "output": "To find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls when drawing 5 balls from a box containing 12 red balls, 8 green balls, and 10 blue balls, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of balls**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total balls} = 12 \\text{ (red)} + 8 \\text{ (green)} + 10 \\text{ (blue)} = 30 \\text{ balls}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 balls from 30**:\n   The number of ways to choose 5 balls from 30 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) items from \\( n \\) items without regard to the order of selection.\n   \\[\n   \\binom{30}{5} = \\frac{30!}{5!(30-5)!} = \\frac{30!}{5! \\cdot 25!}\n   \\]\n   Calculating this:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{30}{5} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{14250600}{120} = 118755\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 12**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12!}{2!(12-2)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2 \\times 1} = 66\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 balls from the 18 non-red balls (8 green + 10 blue)**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{18}{3} = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{4896}{6} = 816\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes**:\n   The total number of ways to choose 2 red balls and 3 non-red balls is the product of the two combinations calculated above:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Favorable outcomes} = \\binom{12}{2} \\times \\binom{18}{3} = 66 \\times 816 = 5376\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the probability**:\n   The probability of drawing exactly 2 red balls when drawing 5 balls is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{exactly 2 red}) = \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{5376}{118755}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   To simplify \\( \\frac{5376}{118755} \\), we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5376 and 118755. After performing the Euclidean algorithm or using a calculator, we find that the GCD is 3.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5376 \\div 3}{118755 \\div 3} = \\frac{1792}{39585}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that exactly 2 of the drawn balls are red is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1792}{39585}}\n\\]"

    "input": "A store sells notebooks for $2 each and pens for $1. If a customer spends a total of $50 on notebooks and pens, and buys twice as many notebooks as pens, how many pens did the customer buy?",
    "output": "Let's denote the number of pens the customer buys as \\( p \\). According to the problem, the customer buys twice as many notebooks as pens, so the number of notebooks can be expressed as \\( 2p \\).\n\nNext, we can set up an equation based on the total cost of the notebooks and pens. The cost of the notebooks is \\( 2 \\) dollars each, and the cost of the pens is \\( 1 \\) dollar each. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = (\\text{Cost of Notebooks}) + (\\text{Cost of Pens})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the number of notebooks and pens, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = (2 \\text{ dollars} \\times 2p) + (1 \\text{ dollar} \\times p)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 4p + p = 5p\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the total cost is $50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n5p = 50\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{50}{5} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the customer bought \\( 10 \\) pens. \n\nTo confirm, we can calculate the number of notebooks purchased:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Notebooks} = 2p = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we can check the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = (20 \\text{ notebooks} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars}) + (10 \\text{ pens} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar}) = 40 + 10 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince the calculations are consistent with the problem statement, we conclude that the number of pens the customer bought is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
