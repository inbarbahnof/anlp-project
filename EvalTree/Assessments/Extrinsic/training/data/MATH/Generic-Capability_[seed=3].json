    "output": "To determine the value of \\( x \\) such that the numbers \\( x \\), \\( 2x + 5 \\), and \\( 3x - 1 \\) form an arithmetic sequence, we need to use the property of arithmetic sequences. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This means that the difference between the second term and the first term should equal the difference between the third term and the second term.\n\nWe can express this mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 5) - x = (3x - 1) - (2x + 5)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify both sides of the equation.\n\n1. **Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   (2x + 5) - x = 2x + 5 - x = x + 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   (3x - 1) - (2x + 5) = 3x - 1 - 2x - 5 = 3x - 2x - 1 - 5 = x - 6\n   \\]\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 5 = x - 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we will solve for \\( x \\).

Let's set up this equation:\n\n\\[\n2(2x + 5) = x + (3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify both sides:\n\n1. **Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   2(2x + 5) = 4x + 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   x + (3x - 1) = x + 3x - 1 = 4x - 1\n   \\]\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 10 = 4x - 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we will subtract \\( 4x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n10 = -1\n\\]\n\nThis is also a contradiction. \n\nLet's go back to the original condition and check if we can find a value for \\( x \\) that satisfies the arithmetic sequence condition. \n\nWe can also try to set the differences equal to each other:\n\n1. Set the differences equal:\n   \\[\n   (2x + 5) - x = (3x - 1) - (2x + 5)\n   \\]\n\nThis leads us back to the same equation, which is consistent.\n\nSince we have reached a contradiction, it indicates that there is no value of \\( x \\) that can satisfy the condition of forming an arithmetic sequence with the given numbers.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that there is no solution for \\( x \\) that satisfies the condition of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n\\]"

Recall that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nThe product \\( (n - 2)(n - 5) \\) can be prime only in specific cases. Since it is a product of two integers, one of the integers must equal 1 (the only way for a product of two integers to be prime). Therefore, we will consider two cases:\n\n1. \\( n - 2 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( n - 5 = 1 \\)\n\n### Case 1: \\( n - 2 = 1 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = 1 \\implies n = 3\n\\]\n\nNow we check if \\( n = 3 \\) makes \\( n^2 - 7n + 10 \\) a prime number:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 7n + 10 = 3^2 - 7 \\cdot 3 + 10 = 9 - 21 + 10 = -2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(-2\\) is not a prime number, we discard this case.\n\n### Case 2: \\( n - 5 = 1 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn - 5 = 1 \\implies n = 6\n\\]\n\nNow we check if \\( n = 6 \\) makes \\( n^2 - 7n + 10 \\) a prime number:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 7n + 10 = 6^2 - 7 \\cdot 6 + 10 = 36 - 42 + 10 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 4 \\) is not a prime number, we discard this case as well.\n\n### Additional Cases\n\nNext, we consider the case where one of the factors is \\(-1\\) (since the product can also be negative):\n\n1. \\( n - 2 = -1 \\)\n2. \\( n - 5 = -1 \\)\n\n#### Sub-case 1: \\( n - 2 = -1 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = -1 \\implies n = 1\n\\]\n\nNow we check if \\( n = 1 \\) makes \\( n^2 - 7n + 10 \\) a prime number:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 7n + 10 = 1^2 - 7 \\cdot 1 + 10 = 1 - 7 + 10 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 4 \\) is not a prime number, we discard this case.\n\n#### Sub-case 2: \\( n - 5 = -1 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn - 5 = -1 \\implies n = 4\n\\]\n\nNow we check if \\( n = 4 \\) makes \\( n^2 - 7n + 10 \\) a prime number:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 7n + 10 = 4^2 - 7 \\cdot 4 + 10 = 16 - 28 + 10 = -2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(-2\\) is not a prime number, we discard this case as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter checking all possible cases, we find that there are no positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 7n + 10 \\) is a prime number. Therefore, the sum of all such positive integers \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"

    "output": "To find the probability that the sum of the results from rolling a six-sided die three times is greater than 15, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of outcomes**: \n   Each die has 6 faces, and since we roll the die three times, the total number of outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6^3 = 216\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the range of possible sums**: \n   The minimum sum occurs when all dice show 1, which is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n   \\]\n   The maximum sum occurs when all dice show 6, which is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the possible sums range from 3 to 18.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes**: \n   We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum is greater than 15.

Therefore, the area of the garden is:\n   \\[\n   A = 12 \\times 9 = 108 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the total area**:\n   Let \\( x \\) be the width of the path.

    "output": "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the area of the rectangle defined by the given corners: \\((2,3)\\), \\((2,-1)\\), \\((-4,-1)\\), and \\((-4,3)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the rectangle\n\nThe corners of the rectangle can be grouped as follows:\n- Top corners: \\((2,3)\\) and \\((-4,3)\\)\n- Bottom corners: \\((2,-1)\\) and \\((-4,-1)\\)\n\n#### Width of the rectangle:\nThe width can be calculated by finding the distance between the x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost corners:\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = x_{\\text{right}} - x_{\\text{left}} = 2 - (-4) = 2 + 4 = 6\n\\]\n\n#### Height of the rectangle:\nThe height can be calculated by finding the distance between the y-coordinates of the top and bottom corners:\n\\[\n\\text{Height} = y_{\\text{top}} - y_{\\text{bottom}} = 3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangle\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} = 6 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the left half of the rectangle\n\nThe left half of the rectangle is defined by the vertical line that bisects the rectangle. Since the rectangle spans from \\(x = -4\\) to \\(x = 2\\), the midpoint in the x-direction is:\n\\[\nx_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{-4 + 2}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\nThe left half of the rectangle extends from \\(x = -4\\) to \\(x = -2\\) and retains the same height from \\(y = -1\\) to \\(y = 3\\).\n\n#### Width of the left half:\n\\[\n\\text{Width}_{\\text{left}} = -2 - (-4) = -2 + 4 = 2\n\\]\n\n#### Height of the left half:\nThe height remains the same as the original rectangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Height}_{\\text{left}} = 4\n\\]\n\n#### Area of the left half:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{left}} = \\text{Width}_{\\text{left}} \\times \\text{Height}_{\\text{left}} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability\n\nThe probability \\(P\\) that a randomly chosen point from the area of the rectangle will be located in the left half is given by the ratio of the area of the left half to the area of the rectangle:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{A_{\\text{left}}}{A} = \\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the probability that a point chosen at random from the area of the rectangle will be located in the region formed by the rectangle's left half is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]"
