    "output": "To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of each type of fruit sold:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number of apples sold.\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of bananas sold.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cherries sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following information:\n\n1. The total number of fruits sold is 120:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. The number of bananas sold is twice the number of apples sold:\n   \\[\n   b = 2a\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of cherries sold is five less than the number of bananas:\n   \\[\n   c = b - 5\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) into the first equation.\n\nFirst, substitute \\( b = 2a \\) into the equation for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = 2a - 5\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute both \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) into the total fruits equation:\n\\[\na + b + c = 120\n\\]\nbecomes\n\\[\na + 2a + (2a - 5) = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\\[\na + 2a + 2a - 5 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n5a - 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, add 5 to both sides:\n\\[\n5a = 125\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\\[\na = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of apples sold is \\( 25 \\).\n\nTo verify, we can calculate the number of bananas and cherries sold:\n\n1. Calculate \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = 2a = 2 \\times 25 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   c = b - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45\n   \\]\n\nNow, check the total:\n\\[\na + b + c = 25 + 50 + 45 = 120\n\\]\n\nSince the total is correct, we conclude that the number of apples sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]"

The area of the triangle formed by the points \\( (0, 0) \\), \\( (0, 6) \\), and \\( (-4, 6) \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n   The base of the triangle is the segment from \\( (0, 6) \\) to \\( (-4, 6) \\), which has a length of 4. The height is the distance from \\( (0, 0) \\) to the line \\( y = 6 \\), which is 6.\n\n   The area of the triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\n   The area of the rectangle that lies inside the circle is thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area inside the circle} = 12\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we conclude that the area of the portion of the rectangle that lies inside the circle after the transformation is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

For \\( x - 4y \\geq -2 \\), we test the same point \\( (0, 0) \\):\n   \\[\n   0 - 4(0) \\geq -2 \\implies 0 \\geq -2 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the region above the line \\( x - 4y = -2 \\) is part of the solution.\n\n### Step 4: Find the intersection points\n\nTo find the vertices of the feasible region, we need to find the intersection of the two lines:\n1. From \\( 2x + 3y = 12 \\)\n2. From \\( x - 4y = -2 \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\nx = 4y - 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\\[\n2(4y - 2) + 3y = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n8y - 4 + 3y = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n11y - 4 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n11y = 16 \\implies y = \\frac{16}{11}\n\\]\n\nNow substituting \\( y \\) back to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 4\\left(\\frac{16}{11}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{64}{11} - \\frac{22}{11} = \\frac{42}{11}\n\\]\n\nThus, the intersection point is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{42}{11}, \\frac{16}{11}\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine integer values of \\( x \\)\n\nNow we need to find the maximum integer value of \\( x \\) that satisfies both inequalities. The maximum integer less than \\( \\frac{42}{11} \\) (which is approximately \\( 3.818 \\)) is \\( 3 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Verify \\( x = 3 \\)\n\nWe need to check if \\( x = 3 \\) satisfies both inequalities:\n1. For \\( 2x + 3y < 12 \\):\n   \\[\n   2(3) + 3y < 12 \\implies 6 + 3y < 12 \\implies 3y < 6 \\implies y < 2\n   \\]\n   This is satisfied for \\( y < 2 \\).\n\n2. For \\( x - 4y \\geq -2 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 - 4y \\geq -2 \\implies -4y \\geq -5 \\implies y \\leq \\frac{5}{4}\n   \\]\n   This is satisfied for \\( y \\leq \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\nSince both inequalities are satisfied for \\( x = 3 \\), we conclude that the maximum integer value of \\( x \\) that satisfies both inequalities is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"

One vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle, and the opposite vertex is at the bottom.\n\n1. **Identify the Circle's Center and Radius**:\n   The center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system. The radius of the circle is 10 units, so the equation of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Positioning the Rectangle**:\n   Since one vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle and the opposite vertex is at the bottom, we can place these vertices at the points (0, 10) and (0, -10) respectively. \n\n3. **Finding the Other Two Vertices**:\n   The other two vertices of the rectangle will be located on the horizontal line that bisects the circle. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the other two vertices as \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\). \n\n4. **Using the Circle's Equation**:\n   Since these vertices must also lie on the circle, we can substitute \\(y = 10\\) into the circle's equation to find \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 100 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n   This means that the rectangle is actually a vertical line segment, which is not what we want. \n\n5. **Revising the Rectangle's Orientation**:\n   Instead, we can consider the rectangle's vertices at \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\) where \\(x\\) can take any value such that the rectangle remains inscribed in the circle.

If A and B are both in the committee, we only need to choose 2 more members from the remaining 8 people (since A and B are already chosen).\n\nUsing the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2!6!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 8! \\), \\( 2! \\), and \\( 6! \\):\n\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 6! = 720 \\)\n\nNow substituting back into the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to form a committee that includes both A and B.\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the restricted committees from the total\n\nTo find the number of valid committees that do not include both A and B, we subtract the number of committees that include both A and B from the total number of committees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid Committees} = \\text{Total Committees} - \\text{Committees with A and B}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid Committees} = 210 - 28 = 182\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the number of different committees that can be formed, ensuring that A and B do not work together, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{182}\n\\]"
