    "output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many different teams of 3 can be formed from a group of 10 students, with the condition that at least one member of the team must be a student who has previously won a science fair.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (the total number of students)\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (the number of students in each team)\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of teams without restrictions\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 students from 10 without any restrictions.

    "input": "A rectangle is inscribed in a circle with a radius of 10 units. If one vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle and the opposite vertex is located at the bottom, what is the area of the rectangle in square units?",
    "output": "To solve the problem, we start by visualizing the situation. We have a circle with a radius of 10 units, and a rectangle inscribed in this circle. One vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle, and the opposite vertex is at the bottom.\n\n1. **Identify the Circle's Center and Radius**:\n   The center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system. The radius of the circle is 10 units, so the equation of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Positioning the Rectangle**:\n   Since one vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle and the opposite vertex is at the bottom, we can place these vertices at the points (0, 10) and (0, -10) respectively. \n\n3. **Finding the Other Two Vertices**:\n   The other two vertices of the rectangle will be located on the horizontal line that bisects the circle. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the other two vertices as \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\). \n\n4. **Using the Circle's Equation**:\n   Since these vertices must also lie on the circle, we can substitute \\(y = 10\\) into the circle's equation to find \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 100 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n   This means that the rectangle is actually a vertical line segment, which is not what we want. \n\n5. **Revising the Rectangle's Orientation**:\n   Instead, we can consider the rectangle's vertices at \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\) where \\(x\\) can take any value such that the rectangle remains inscribed in the circle. The width of the rectangle will be \\(2x\\) (from \\(-x\\) to \\(x\\)) and the height will be the distance between the top and bottom vertices, which is \\(20\\) units (from \\(10\\) to \\(-10\\)).\n\n6. **Calculating the Area**:\n   The area \\(A\\) of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} = (2x) \\times (20)\n   \\]\n   However, we need to find the maximum width \\(2x\\) that can fit within the circle. The maximum width occurs when the rectangle is a square, which happens when the diagonal of the rectangle equals the diameter of the circle.\n\n7. **Finding the Diagonal**:\n   The diameter of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times \\text{Radius} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n   For a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the relationship between the width \\(w\\), height \\(h\\), and diagonal \\(d\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{w^2 + h^2}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(d = 20\\) and \\(h = 20\\) (the height of the rectangle):\n   \\[\n   20 = \\sqrt{(2x)^2 + 20^2}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides:\n   \\[\n   400 = (2x)^2 + 400\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   (2x)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(2x = 0\\), which means \\(x = 0\\) again, indicating that the rectangle cannot have a width.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   The only configuration that satisfies the conditions of the problem is a rectangle with a height of 20 units and a width of 0 units, which results in an area of:\n   \\[\n   A = 0 \\times 20 = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{200}\\) square units."
