    "input": "A farmer has a rectangular field that measures 50 meters by 30 meters. He wants to create a walking path that is 2 meters wide along the inside of the entire perimeter of the field. What will be the area of the path in square meters?",
    "output": "To find the area of the walking path that the farmer wants to create, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the entire rectangular field.**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n   \\]\n   For the farmer's field:\n   - Length = 50 meters\n   - Width = 30 meters\n\n   Thus, the area of the field is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{field}} = 50 \\times 30 = 1500 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the dimensions of the inner rectangle after the path is created.**\n   The walking path is 2 meters wide along the inside of the entire perimeter. This means we need to subtract 2 meters from each side of the field's dimensions.\n\n   - New length = \\( 50 - 2 - 2 = 50 - 4 = 46 \\) meters\n   - New width = \\( 30 - 2 - 2 = 30 - 4 = 26 \\) meters\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the inner rectangle (the area of the field without the path).**\n   Using the new dimensions:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{inner}} = \\text{new length} \\times \\text{new width} = 46 \\times 26\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we calculate \\( 46 \\times 26 \\):\n   \\[\n   46 \\times 26 = 1196 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the walking path.**\n   The area of the path is the area of the original field minus the area of the inner rectangle:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{path}} = A_{\\text{field}} - A_{\\text{inner}} = 1500 - 1196\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{path}} = 304 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final answer.**\n   The area of the walking path is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{304}\n   \\] square meters."
