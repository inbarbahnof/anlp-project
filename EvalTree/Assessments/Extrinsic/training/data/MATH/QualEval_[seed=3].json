    "input": "A farmer has a rectangular field that measures 120 meters by 80 meters. He wants to plant a row of trees along the entire perimeter of the field, placing one tree every 4 meters. After planting the trees, he decides to plant a flower bed at each corner of the field, where each bed occupies a 2-meter by 2-meter area. \n\nHow many trees did the farmer plant along the perimeter of the field, after accounting for the flower beds?",
    "output": "To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field.**\n2. **Determine how many trees can be planted along the perimeter without considering the flower beds.**\n3. **Calculate the area occupied by the flower beds and adjust the perimeter accordingly.**\n4. **Recalculate the number of trees that can be planted after accounting for the flower beds.**\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field\n\nThe formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nFor this field, the length is 120 meters and the width is 80 meters. Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (120 + 80) = 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine how many trees can be planted along the perimeter\n\nThe farmer plants one tree every 4 meters along the perimeter. To find the total number of trees, we divide the perimeter by the distance between the trees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of trees} = \\frac{P}{\\text{distance between trees}} = \\frac{400}{4} = 100\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the area occupied by the flower beds\n\nEach flower bed occupies an area of 2 meters by 2 meters. Since there are 4 corners, the total area occupied by the flower beds is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one flower bed} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of flower beds} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the area occupied by the flower beds does not directly affect the number of trees planted along the perimeter, but we need to consider how the flower beds affect the placement of trees at the corners.\n\n### Step 4: Adjust the number of trees for the flower beds\n\nSince each flower bed occupies a 2-meter by 2-meter area at each corner, we need to consider the placement of trees at the corners. The trees are planted every 4 meters, and since the flower beds occupy the corners, we will not plant trees at the exact corners.\n\nThe corners of the field are at the following coordinates:\n- (0, 0)\n- (120, 0)\n- (120, 80)\n- (0, 80)\n\nSince the flower beds occupy the corners, we will not plant trees at these 4 corner positions. \n\nNow, we need to check how many trees are planted along the straight sections of the perimeter. The total number of trees calculated earlier (100) includes the trees at the corners. Since we are not planting trees at the 4 corners, we need to subtract these from the total.\n\nThus, the number of trees planted along the perimeter after accounting for the flower beds is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Adjusted number of trees} = 100 - 4 = 96\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of trees the farmer planted along the perimeter of the field, after accounting for the flower beds, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}\n\\]"

One vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle, and the opposite vertex is at the bottom.\n\n1. **Identify the Circle's Center and Radius**:\n   The center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system. The radius of the circle is 10 units, so the equation of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Positioning the Rectangle**:\n   Since one vertex of the rectangle is at the top of the circle and the opposite vertex is at the bottom, we can place these vertices at the points (0, 10) and (0, -10) respectively. \n\n3. **Finding the Other Two Vertices**:\n   The other two vertices of the rectangle will be located on the horizontal line that bisects the circle. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the other two vertices as \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\). \n\n4. **Using the Circle's Equation**:\n   Since these vertices must also lie on the circle, we can substitute \\(y = 10\\) into the circle's equation to find \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 100 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n   This means that the rectangle is actually a vertical line segment, which is not what we want. \n\n5. **Revising the Rectangle's Orientation**:\n   Instead, we can consider the rectangle's vertices at \\((x, 10)\\) and \\((x, -10)\\) where \\(x\\) can take any value such that the rectangle remains inscribed in the circle. The width of the rectangle will be \\(2x\\) (from \\(-x\\) to \\(x\\)) and the height will be the distance between the top and bottom vertices, which is \\(20\\) units (from \\(10\\) to \\(-10\\)).\n\n6. **Calculating the Area**:\n   The area \\(A\\) of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} = (2x) \\times (20)\n   \\]\n   However, we need to find the maximum width \\(2x\\) that can fit within the circle. The maximum width occurs when the rectangle is a square, which happens when the diagonal of the rectangle equals the diameter of the circle.\n\n7. **Finding the Diagonal**:\n   The diameter of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times \\text{Radius} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n   For a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the relationship between the width \\(w\\), height \\(h\\), and diagonal \\(d\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{w^2 + h^2}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(d = 20\\) and \\(h = 20\\) (the height of the rectangle):\n   \\[\n   20 = \\sqrt{(2x)^2 + 20^2}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides:\n   \\[\n   400 = (2x)^2 + 400\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   (2x)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(2x = 0\\), which means \\(x = 0\\) again, indicating that the rectangle cannot have a width.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   The only configuration that satisfies the conditions of the problem is a rectangle with a height of 20 units and a width of 0 units, which results in an area of:\n   \\[\n   A = 0 \\times 20 = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{200}\\) square units."

Calculate \\( 12 \\times 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 11 = 132\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply the result by 10:\n   \\[\n   132 \\times 10 = 1320\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result by 9:\n   \\[\n   1320 \\times 9 = 11880\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 8:\n   \\[\n   11880 \\times 8 = 95040\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different arrangements of 5 songs from 12 different songs is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{95040}\n\\]"

The reading assignment is as follows: each student reads 1 book in the first month, 2 books in the second month, 3 books in the third month, and so on, until they read 12 books in the twelfth month. \n\nIf at the end of the year, 15 students completed their assignments fully, while 10 students each read exactly half of their assigned books, and the remaining students read none, how many books were read in total by all students by the end of the year?",
    "output": "To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many books each student is assigned to read over the course of the year.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of books assigned to each student:**\n   Each student reads a specific number of books each month:\n   - In the 1st month: 1 book\n   - In the 2nd month: 2 books\n   - In the 3rd month: 3 books\n   - ...\n   - In the 12th month: 12 books\n\n   The total number of books read by each student over the year can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers:\n   \\[\n   S_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the number of months (12 in this case).\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S_{12} = \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = \\frac{156}{2} = 78\n   \\]\n   So, each student is assigned to read a total of 78 books over the year.\n\n2. **Determine the number of books read by each group of students:**\n   - **15 students completed their assignments fully:** \n     Each of these students read 78 books.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total books read by these students} = 15 \\times 78 = 1170\n     \\]\n\n   - **10 students read exactly half of their assigned books:**\n     Half of 78 books is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{78}{2} = 39\n     \\]\n     So, these 10 students read:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total books read by these students} = 10 \\times 39 = 390\n     \\]\n\n   - **The remaining students read none:**\n     There are 30 students in total, and we have accounted for 15 + 10 = 25 students.
